      <h1>Making socket.io Work With Multiple Nodes</h1>
      <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> is the most popular websocket
      implementation library that is available to the application develeper.
      However for a long time it was full of bugs, had a lot of architectural
      issues and is not maintained. But changing all that socket.io version
      1.0.0 came out. At this time the latest stable socket.io version is 1.1.0
      and its so much improved.<br />
      <br />
      If you are excited about the websockets technology and socket.io helped
      you to explore it, you'd be delighted to here about this all new rebirth
      of it. But trying to migrate to the new version from the old one is where
      you'd lose most of that delight. Specially if you have multiple nodes
      running on your server for load balancing.<br />
      <br />
      When multiple nodes are running on the server side they collectively are
      responsible for handling the socket.io clients. Clients would not have
      much idea of which server node they are dealing with. This means that the
      server nodes need some common ground to share information about the
      clients on, so that any one of them can handle any client. In socket.io
      0.9.* this ground is given the name <b>store</b>. A store can be
      implemented using any storage technology according to a store interface.
      The <b>redis-store</b> was the most used.<br />
      <br />
      There are many fundamental problems with this architecture. One of the
      main ones being that the store used will contain every single details
      about every single client that connects. This makes drastically decreases
      the possibility of horizontal scaling. It would work great for few nodes
      with limited number of subscribed clients but when the number of clients
      touch millions this should give a lot of problems. Another is that it is
      not possible to add new nodes to the cluster without taking the whole
      cluster down. This is because new nodes do not update with the data
      available with already running nodes and are unable to handle requests
      from the existing clients.<br />
      <br />
      So they have removed '<b>stores</b>' from the new socket.io version and
      rightly so.<br />
      <br />
      The successor of the <b>redis-store</b> will be
      <b
        ><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/socket.io-redis" target="_blank"
          >redis-adapter</a
        ></b
      >. Here is how my diff looked like after the substitution of redis-adapter
      instead of the redis-store.<br />
      <br />
      <div
        style="
          background: #ffffff;
          border-width: 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em 0.8em;
          border: solid gray;
          overflow: auto;
          padding: 0.2em 0.6em;
          width: auto;
        "
      >
        <pre
          style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0"
        >     var sio = require('socket.io');
     io = sio.listen(server);
 
<span style="color: #a00000;">-    var subscriber = redis.createClient(</span>
<span style="color: #a00000;">-                         config.redisPort, config.redisHost, config.redisOptions);</span>
<span style="color: #a00000;">-    var publisher = redis.createClient(</span>
<span style="color: #a00000;">-                         config.redisPort, config.redisHost, config.redisOptions);</span>
 
<span style="color: #a00000;">-    var RedisStore = require("socket.io-redis");</span>
 
<span style="color: #a00000;">-    io.set('store', new RedisStore(</span>
<span style="color: #a00000;">-             {pubClient:publisher, subClient:subscriber, host:config.redisHost,port:config.redisPort}));</span>


<span style="color: #00a000;">+    var redisadapter = require('socket.io-redis');</span>
<span style="color: #00a000;">+    io.adapter(redisadapter({ host: config.redisHost, port: config.redisPort }));</span>
</pre>
      </div>
      <br />
      But the migration does not end here. The new socket.io requires the nodes
      to have sticky sessions in order to operate.<br />
      <br />
      Sticky sessions ensures that a subsequent request would be forwarded to
      the same node that handled the previous requests corresponding to that
      request. So IP address based sticky sessions make sure that all the
      requests from a particular IP address is sent to the same node.<br />
      <br />
      How you should implement sticky sessions depends on the technology you use
      in the load balancer. If you are using Nginx it can be configured in the
      setup. Or if you are using pm2 you are
      <a href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/389" target="_blank"
        >not that lucky (yet)</a
      >.<br />
      <br />
      Or it is possible that you use the node cluster module for the load
      balancing. In that case '<b
        ><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/sticky-session" target="_blank"
          >sticky-session</a
        >'</b
      >
      node module should give you a hand. But its still not very mature and
      could have many more features. Anyway it works.<br />
      <br />
      Wrapping the server instance in sticky function should do it.<br />
      <br />
      <div
        style="
          background: #ffffff;
          border-width: 0.1em 0.1em 0.1em 0.8em;
          border: solid gray;
          overflow: auto;
          padding: 0.2em 0.6em;
          width: auto;
        "
      >
        <pre
          style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0"
        ><span style="color: #00a000;">+    var sticky = require('sticky-session');</span>

<span style="color: #a00000;">-    var server = http.createServer(handler);</span>
<span style="color: #00a000;">+    var server = sticky(http.createServer(handler));</span>
</pre>
      </div>
      <br />
      And now socket.io 1.1.0 starts working! Its really not that difficult but
      there are not much help around the internet to the migrater. Once many
      stackoverflow questions around are answered and many new tutorials are put
      up socket.io would be great to work with.<br />
