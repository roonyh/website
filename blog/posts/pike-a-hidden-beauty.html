      <h1>Pike, A Hidden Beauty</h1>
      <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left" trbidi="on">
        Last few days I was getting myself familiar with an interesting project
        named
        <a
          href="https://github.com/ekita/sTeam/tree/steam-2.9-source"
          target="_blank"
          >sTeam</a
        >. One of the things that makes it interesting is that its written in
        <a href="http://pike.lysator.liu.se/" target="_blank">pike</a>. Pike is
        the programming language that is used to write it.<br />
        <br />
        Don't worry if you haven't heard of pike. Many people have not. Its a
        relatively undescovered language. Average google search along the lines
        of "Pike tutorials" would not get you much other than this
        <a href="http://pike.lysator.liu.se/docs/tutorial/" target="_blank"
          >official beginner tutorial</a
        >. The stackoverflow tag 'pike' has mere 8 subscribers. There is only
        the single official intrepretter and not many IDEs except for
        <a href="http://wiki.gotpike.org/PikeTools" target="_blank"
          >an emacs mode and an eclipse plugin</a
        >. Text editor I use, gedit, by default does not know how to highlight
        syntax of a .pike file.<br />
        <br />
        But installing pike and trying it out makes you wonder.. why? why don't
        we use this more.<br />
        <br />
        Pike is very attractive just like an unseen hidden forrest flower.<br />
        <br />
        In my short career so far I have been lucky enough to use many
        languages. Most of my assignments in the university are to be done using
        C or Java. My final year project is done with
        <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora" target="_blank"
          >Diaspora</a
        >, which is ruby. I coded python for
        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/soc/" target="_blank">melange</a> in
        Google summer of code. During an internship with
        <a href="http://www.ironone.com/" target="_blank">IroneOne</a> I worked
        mostly on an iOS app which is objective C. And my first task in my first
        job was building a nodejs application, which is Javascript. While going
        through the
        <a href="http://pike.lysator.liu.se/docs/tutorial/" target="_blank"
          >tutorial</a
        >, I felt pike is made of good parts of many of those languages.<br />
        <br />
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Duck Typing</h4>
        <br />
        There are both pros and cons of Duck Typing. While coding python, ruby
        and javascript code I felt great and previlaged to be able to use
        dynamic data typing. But it wasn't unclear to me, that some of the code
        that takes advantage of Duck typing could lead to problems. Specially if
        they are not documented or the documentation is not reffered. Sometimes
        it took some of my time to understand poorly documented javascript
        APIs.<br />
        <br />
        On the other hand, sometimes, In early days as an undergraduate I felt
        frustrated to not being able to return couple of integers and a string
        in a single array from a java function.<br />
        <br />
        Pike has a simple yet effective solution. In addition to its three basic
        types, int float and string it has another queer little type, mixed. You
        can specify a variable as mixed and and store any value irrespective of
        whether it is an int float string or even a complex type.<br />

        Arrays declared to hold mixed types, or not declared to hold any type,
        can contain values of mixed types. A function declared to return mixed
        type can return anything.<br />
        <br />
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Syntax</h4>
        <br />
        I feel syntax in pike manages, again to get the best, most elagant bits
        out of the languages I am familiar with. It uses c style parantheses to
        identify scopes of funtions conditional and loop statesments. In my view
        much better than pythons awkward tabs/spaces.<br />
        <br />
        Outshining c it has a simple 'dictionary' data structure known as
        mappings, with elegant syntax.<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace"
          ><b
            >mapping(string:string) batsmen = (["Sangakkara": "Sri Lanka",
            "Maxwell":"Australia", "Kohli": "India"])</b
          ></span
        ><br />
        <br />
        Arrays,<br />
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace"
          ><b
            >array(string) cricketers = ({"McCullum", "De Villiars", "Malinga",
            "O'Brien"})</b
          ></span
        ><br />
        <br />
        In my view pike syntax is pleasing to the eye...<br />
        <br />
        <h4 style="text-align: left">Interpreter</h4>
        <br />
        You probably have guessed from whats mentioned so far that pike is
        interpreted. Yes, Pike comes with an official interpreter named
        <a
          href="http://pike.lysator.liu.se/generated/manual/ref/chapter_7.html"
          target="_blank"
          >Hilfe</a
        >.<br />
        A real time interpreter is something I find very useful to learn a
        language. It is of great value when developing as well. You can just
        enter few lines in the interpreter and see if you got the syntax or the
        logic correct. It's much easier and quicker than writing a program and
        compiling and testing or looking through documentation.<br />
        <br />
        Further pike does not have many external libraries, but its distributed
        with
        <a
          href="http://pike.lysator.liu.se/about/pike/modules.xml"
          target="_blank"
          >many modules</a
        >
        so you can get most of your work done with pike itself.<br />
        <br />
        In
        <a href="http://www.topgear.com/uk/" target="_blank">Top Gear</a>
        consumer advice style, pike would not treat you like a kid and hold you
        back from doing stuff freely, nor would it consider you a saint and over
        trust you with everything.<br />
        <br />
        It probably is not a good idea to use pike in your next big project, for
        the very little support you'd get, but definitely worth knowing about
        and trying it out in one of those pet projects.
